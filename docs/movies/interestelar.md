## A Hard-Science Movie
  
What this means *hard-science* movie??
It's that this movie was reviewed by scientists
to verify if the possibilities it's possible.
  
Despite the final part of the film,
IN MY POINT OF VIEW,
the film it's pretty good, the image,
the history, the motivations, the methodoly to tell
the characters lives and the search for a new habitat.
  
I recommend.
