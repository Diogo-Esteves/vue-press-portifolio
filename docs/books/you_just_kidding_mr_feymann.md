# Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!

A book that I've read in a few months and I feel a necessity to read it again.
One history sticks in my mind, when he describe the visit in my country, Brazil,
a short passage over here, but he could perceive some aspects about the
brazilian academy and why it's not good for all.
  
In general the book keeps the reader with the full attention.
